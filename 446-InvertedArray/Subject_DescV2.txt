introduction to business structuring
this course introduces students to the more advanced areas of taxation including corporate reorganizations partnerships and trusts
tax planning for the owner-manager and executive
owner-managers usually have dynamic tax circumstances which demand that the tax advisor adapt their thinking quickly and effectively  owner-managers also require their advisors to bring significant value to their businesses and often look for instant gratification  this course is designed with this in mind  students will learn the tools required to bring value to their clients through practical application
an introduction to accounting for income taxes
the goal of financial accounting is to reflect the economic activities of the firm in its financial statements this course introduces students to the accounting for income taxes with a particular focus on analyzing differences between accounting and tax treatments computing tax provisions and disclosing tax information in corporate financial statements the course also provides exposure to the both internal and external users of tax accounting disclosures in doing so the course builds a solid grounding in the preparation of accounting information but also helps students gain an appreciation for the role financial accounting in tax planning and compliance decisions
research paper
